# The Gift Angels

### Hi there! I'm Sparsh Hurkat
Welcome to my garage!!
 
This one is the first fully functional website i made. It was for a local e-commerce website called 'The Gift Angels'. I took this project on to upskill myself over the summer break of my first year in college.

As surprising as it sounds now, the website is made with HTML and CSS, with a little bit of Javascript and PHP and  very non-scalable code. But i didn't mind the days of work I put into it because I learnt vital concepts of web development. In the process I learnt the importance of writing scalable code, inventory management, how to host a website and its SEO.

The website was live for 6 months before i took it down as it was almost impossible for me to maintain and update the website along with my studies.

### The Gift Angels is still going strong!!

Its thriving as a primarily offline business. The company realized over a few months of being live that the primary demographic for the products being sold would rather see, touch and feel the products in-person. Further the handful of online customers would rather use popular social media websites like Whatsapp & Instagram to view or buy items. So its thriving in exhibitions, with digital marketing on Instagram.
